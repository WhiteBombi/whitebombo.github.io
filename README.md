# Static web page
A static web page hosted on GitHub for WhiteBombo at [whitebombo.github.io](whitebombo.github.io).

Updated in 'in-progress' and 'master' branches.
The 'in-progress' branch is used as an interim backup storage while the version is under development. Once this version is finished, it will be merged into the 'master' branch. Once the 'master' branch has been synced with local development environment, it will be visible on the static website.
